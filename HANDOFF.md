# Handoff

**Last updated:** 2026-05-23 (HEAD `7f986b5a`)
**Read this first if you're picking up this codebase.** It replaces the need to walk all 29 SESSION-HANDOVER files for the common pickup case.

---

## What this codebase is

VNShop — multi-seller retail marketplace, polyglot microservices, portfolio project.

- **15 backend services** under `services/`. 13 Spring Boot 4.0.6 (Java 25) + 2 NestJS 11 (notification, messaging) + Spring Cloud Gateway (api-gateway).
- **React 18 + Vite SPA** under `fe/`. TanStack Query 5, React Router 7 (data routers), Zod 4, Tailwind 4, Zustand-installed-but-unused (uses Context + Query instead).
- **Per-service Postgres**, Kafka, Redis. Auth via Keycloak with httpOnly-cookie + in-memory access token (FE) and JWT bearer (BE).
- **Event-driven sagas** with outbox + dead-letter pattern in order-service.
- **Two regression suites:** `e2e-day.mjs` API harness and Playwright `fe/e2e/day-simulation.spec.ts` (15/15) — both run against the live stack.

Architecture details: `.sisyphus/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Per-service health: `.sisyphus/STATUS.md`.

---

## Current state (smoke test)

```bash
# FE
cd fe && npm run typecheck   # 2 pre-existing errors (PayPal + checkout)
cd fe && npm test            # 156/156, 25 files
cd fe && npx playwright test e2e/day-simulation.spec.ts --project=chromium  # 15/15, ~27s

# BE (representative — full set is 12 services)
cd services/order-service   && ./mvnw -B test  # 104/104
cd services/payment-service && ./mvnw -B test  # 75/75
cd services/user-service    && ./mvnw -B test  # 116/116
```

**Live-stack verification of pt26 changes** (2026-05-21):
- order-service, payment-service, user-service rebuilt + restarted with the T1 (virtual threads) and T8 (`@HttpExchange`) commits live in their containers.
- All three booted cleanly under the new virtual-thread executor.
- day-simulation Playwright gate ran end-to-end against the fresh stack: **15/15 in 27s**, including the 5 IDOR negative-path tests that exercise the new `@HttpExchange` adapters under real HTTP traffic.
- This is the real verification gate for the runtime behavior — unit tests don't exercise virtual threads or the HTTP proxy wiring.

If any of these break on a fresh clone, the cause is almost always:
- **OneDrive reparse-points** (Windows) — run `node scripts/hydrate.mjs` to re-hydrate cloud-only stubs.
- **Stale containers** — `docker compose down -v && docker compose --profile apps up -d`.

## What shipped recently (pt12 → pt28 arc)

**18 authorization findings closed** + **3 cleanliness items** + **17 modern-feature commits** + **42 unit tests for branch coverage** + **15 day-simulation regression gates** + **i18n duplicate-key fix** + **lucide → Tabler icon migration (39 files)** + **dark-mode coverage sweep (47 files via codemod + theme tokens)** + **9 BE-vs-FE schema drift fixes (cart, user, order list+detail, checkout, review, seller-finance, admin, page)** + **cart-service env wiring + product-service variants[] adapter (9 unit tests)**.

Three thematic waves:

### Wave 1 — Security audit (pt12 → pt23)
End-to-end audit of every controller in 13 services against three anti-patterns:

1. **Authoritative wire fields** — DTO field the BE writes without re-deriving from JWT. (e.g. `buyerId` in request body)
2. **IDOR via missing JWT-vs-id cross-check** — endpoint mutates by id without verifying ownership.
3. **Path-mounted self-id** — `/users/{userId}/x` instead of `/users/me/x`.

**Findings ledger** (full table in `docs/AUDIT-SUMMARY-2026-05-21.md`):
- 5 high-severity (real money / refund / privilege escalation): payment amount tampering, seller self-credit, return-complete IDOR, image-activate IDOR, image avScanClean bypass, flash-sale buyerId impersonation
- 11 medium-severity (PII leak / cross-user write / IDOR)
- 2 low-severity

**The merge gate for new endpoints** (durable artifact):
1. Does the wire shape contain anything authoritative? Drop and resolve from JWT.
2. Does the use case look up another resource by id? Cross-check ownership at the use-case boundary.
3. Is there a "wrong-X → 403" test in `fe/e2e/day-simulation.spec.ts`?

### Wave 2 — Modern-feature utilization (pt26)
After the security work, two parallel reviewers (BE: Java 25 / Spring Boot 4 / NestJS 11; FE: React 18 / RR7 / TanStack 5 / Zod 4) found 14 places we were leaving features on the table.

Closed in 10 task commits (T1–T10):

| Task | What | Win |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | `spring.threads.virtual.enabled=true` on 11 servlet services + ReentrantLock fix | Eliminates thread-pool exhaustion under load |
| T2 | BuildKit cache mounts on 15 Dockerfiles | 60-80% cold-build speedup |
| T3 | Dedupe `usePageVisible` hook | Drift prevention |
| T4 | `z.enum` for status / method schemas | Closed-set type safety |
| T5 | Shared product mapper (use-products + use-search) | Fixes silent field drop |
| T6 | `queryOptions` builder migration | Type-safe cross-hook invalidation |
| T7 | `useSuspenseQuery` on 4 page routes | -100 lines of `isLoading`/`isError` boilerplate |
| T8 | `@HttpExchange` for 3 Java adapters | Declarative HTTP, less boilerplate |
| T9 | Branded Zod ids (`OrderId` / `ProductId` / `SellerId`) | Cross-domain id confusion → compile error |
| T10 | RR7 loaders for prefetch | Kills product → seller → reviews waterfall |

Per-task review found 1 Critical (ProductPage migration mid-bail) + 1 Important (`enabled` vestige regression) + 6 Minor; all fixed.

### Wave 3 — i18n / icons / dark mode / BE-shape alignment (pt27 → pt28)
The largest UX correctness pass since pt12.

| Block | What | Win |
|---|---|---|
| pt27 i18n | Duplicate top-level `home` key in `vi.json`/`en.json` was wiping the entire `home.*` namespace at parse time | Hero, greeting, signIn, tabs all render localized strings instead of raw keys |
| pt27 icons | 39 files / ~50 unique icons migrated from `lucide-react@0.487` to `@tabler/icons-react@3.34` via `fe/scripts/migrate-icons.mjs` codemod; emojis on tabs/banners/login replaced with proper Tabler icons | Cohesive visual language; `lucide-react` removed from package.json |
| pt28 theme | `theme.css` token contract documented; dark palette gets 3-step elevation (`--background` `#0b0e14` < `--card` `#151924` < `--surface-elevated` `#1d2230`) | Cards no longer invisible against body in dark mode |
| pt28 dark sweep | `fe/scripts/migrate-dark-tokens.mjs` codemod rewrote 47 files / 678 swaps; HomePage, Root, LoginPage, RegisterPage, PasswordResetPage, AdminPage, SellerPage, etc. all use `bg-card` / `text-foreground` / `text-muted-foreground` / `border-border` | Dark mode is actually dark across every page |
| pt28 schemas | 9 Zod schemas aligned with actual BE DTOs via `transform()` aliasing — cart, user, order (list + detail), checkout calc, shipping options, review, wallet, payout, admin sellers/disputes/payouts/coupons, dashboard summary, page (Spring `number` vs user-service `page`) | Page-wide error fallbacks fixed on `/cart`, `/profile`, `/orders`, `/checkout`, admin/seller dashboards |
| pt28 cart wiring | Added `PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL` to cart-service compose entry + rewrote `ProductHttpClientAdapter` to read price from `variants[0].priceAmount` and image from sortOrder-sorted `images[]` | Cart items show real names + prices instead of UUIDs and 0₫. 9 new unit tests lock it in |
| pt28 seller orders | `/seller/orders/pending` returns `List<OrderResponse>`, FE flattens at the endpoint adapter into the `PendingSubOrder[]` shape SellerOrders expects | Seller pending queue renders again |

---

## What's still open

Three items, the first two deferred with written rationale, the third surfaced during the pt28 schema audit:

1. **PayPal capture round-trip.** Last unproven payment path. Manual browser test, must run while logged in as the buyer who owns the payment. Cannot be automated within this session.
2. **Shipping tracking ownership check.** `GET /shipping/tracking/{code}` lets any authenticated user read any tracking code. Deferred in pt22 because: (a) tracking codes are carrier-opaque, not enumerable; (b) fix needs cross-service architecture work (shipping has no orderId/buyerId mapping); (c) GHN/GHTK/USPS/FedEx all expose tracking by code alone — pinning ours would be stricter than industry.
3. **VNPay/MoMo redirectUrl is missing from `PaymentResponse`.** FE does `window.location.href = init.redirectUrl` after `POST /payment/vnpay/create`, but the BE response only carries `paymentId / orderId / buyerId / amount / method / status / transactionRef / createdAt` — no `redirectUrl`. So checkout currently redirects to `undefined`. Needs product-side direction: BE generates the gateway redirect server-side, or FE constructs it from sandbox config? See pt28 gotcha #62.

Don't reverse #1 or #2 without new product-side direction.

## Operational gotchas (memory)

The `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/` directory persists context across sessions. Live entries:

- **`feedback_post_agent_quality_pass`** — after every sub-agent merges, do clean-code / DDD / DRY / SOLID review and fix violations.
- **`feedback_session_handover_md`** — refresh `docs/SESSION-HANDOVER-*.md` at end of every session.
- **`feedback_detect_silent_bail`** — sub-agents bail mid-task and pass off narration as completion. Verify diff before trusting report.
- **`feedback_worktree_base_ref_divergence`** — agent worktrees may be based on `origin/main`; if local diverged, correct-looking agent work can silently delete recent commits on merge.
- **`feedback_split_long_agent_runs`** — long Opus sub-agent runs hit Cloudflare 524s; split into smaller parallel Sonnet agents.
- **`feedback_onedrive_reparse_point_gotcha`** — OneDrive cloud-stubs silently break Playwright discovery and Docker builds. Detect via PowerShell `Mode -a---l`, hydrate via `node scripts/hydrate.mjs`.
- **`feedback_virtual_thread_pinning_synchronized`** — when virtual threads are on, `synchronized` + blocking I/O pins the carrier thread. Use `ReentrantLock` instead.
- **`feedback_git_checkout_scope_creep`** — `git checkout -- <dir>` discards every unstaged change under that path, not just the codemod's. `git status -- <dir>` first or use selective stash. (pt27 — got bitten twice in one session)

In-handover gotchas (numbered #40–53 across pt15–pt26): see the per-block files for full text. Highlights:

- **#41** — wire-field-never-populated is the hardest hole to spot. Any DTO field the FE doesn't send is either dead or a security boundary the BE trusts blindly.
- **#46** — vulnerabilities at the intersection of two anti-patterns hide longest. Image-activate had IDOR + avScanClean bypass at the same site; each looked benign alone.
- **#48** — "all endpoints unauthenticated" on a per-service config is a false alarm when the gateway is the auth boundary. Always check `services/api-gateway/.../SecurityConfig.java` permitAll matchers + `RouteConfig.java` route definitions before flagging.
- **#49** — Spring's JSON binding silently drops unknown wire fields. The audit signal isn't "the BE rejects the field" — it's "the BE doesn't *use* the field."
- **#51** — self-review is theater. Always dispatch an independent code-reviewer subagent for post-agent quality passes; the same agent that wrote the code carries the same blind spots into review.
- **#52** — `useSuspenseQuery` cannot be conditionally enabled, but `*Options` factories shared with plain `useQuery` callers still need `enabled: !!id`. The Suspense path passes a defined id from URL params, so the gate is a no-op there; the non-Suspense callers need it.
- **#54** — `git checkout -- <dir>` discards every unstaged change under that dir, not just the codemod's. (memory above + pt27 doc)
- **#55** — codemod-only sweeps miss inline `style={{ background: ... }}`. After a Tailwind-only codemod, immediately grep for them and audit. (pt28)
- **#56** — schema test fixtures must be derived from BE responses, not hand-rolled to match FE expectations. Stale fixtures hide drift. (pt28)
- **#58** — Zod parse failures want a `transform()` aliasing both shapes, NOT a `.passthrough()` shortcut. The latter buries drift until a downstream consumer crashes. (pt28)
- **#59** — silent offline-mode branches in BE adapters need loud failure modes. cart-service's missing `PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL` produced UUID-named 0₫ items in production with zero log noise. (pt28)
- **#60** — order-service has no order-level `status` field; FE must derive it from `subOrders[].fulfillmentStatus + paymentStatus`. (pt28)
- **#61** — drift clusters. After fixing one schema, audit ALL of them. The pt28 audit turned up 8 more after `cart`. (pt28)
- **#62** — VNPay/MoMo `PaymentResponse` has no `redirectUrl` field. Missing BE functionality, not schema drift. (pt28)
- **#63** — `/orders` list and `/orders/{id}` are different shapes; the same Zod schema can absorb both via a transform that handles three status cases (already-UI / raw-enum / derive-from-sub-orders). (pt28)
- **#64** — `/seller/orders/pending` returns nested orders; flatten at the endpoint adapter to keep the page contract stable. (pt28)
- **#65** — Spring `Page<T>` uses `number` for page index; user-service `PublicSellersPageResponse` uses `page`. Accept both. (pt28)

## How to resume work

### Pick something specific
- **PayPal capture** — start a browser session, log in as the buyer who placed an unconfirmed PayPal order, walk the sandbox, confirm the capture lands in `payment_status`.
- **Observability** — distributed tracing on the new virtual-thread executor, request-id propagation through `@HttpExchange` interfaces, structured logging conventions across services.
- **CI hardening** — matrix `mvnw verify` on every PR, profile-aware compose-up smoke test, automated docker rebuild + day-simulation gate.
- **New feature** — point me at a spec or describe what should exist; the codebase has clean idioms for adding a controller (Spring) or page (React).

### Follow the durable conventions

**New BE endpoint?** Walk the three security questions above. Add a "wrong-X → 403" test to `fe/e2e/day-simulation.spec.ts`.

**New FE query?** Define the `*Options` factory in the relevant `use-*.ts` hook. Use `useSuspenseQuery` for primary route data behind a Suspense boundary; `useQuery` for secondary panels. Reference the queryKey by `*Options.queryKey` for invalidations — never as a string array literal.

**New domain id?** Add a brand to `fe/src/app/types/api/branded-ids.ts` if the id is non-opaque to the FE and crosses domain boundaries. Skip for opaque tokens (idempotency keys, transaction refs).

**New Java service or controller?** Follow the order-service shape: hexagonal layout (`application/`, `domain/`, `infrastructure/`), `JwtPrincipalUtil.currentUserId()` at the controller boundary, port interface + adapter for outbound calls, declarative `@HttpExchange` interface for HTTP outbound.

### Don't fight the tools

- Run sub-agent reviews **independently** of the agent that wrote the code. Self-review misses the same blind spots.
- Use `node scripts/hydrate.mjs` before any Docker rebuild on Windows.
- The skill at `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` is the canonical executor flow when working from a plan: implementer → spec review → quality review → next.
- Don't dispatch multiple implementer subagents in parallel — they conflict on commits. Reviewers in parallel are safe.

## Where to look for what

| Question | File |
|---|---|
| What does the codebase do? | `README.md`, `.sisyphus/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| What is each service's status? | `.sisyphus/STATUS.md` |
| What's the security audit ledger? | `docs/AUDIT-SUMMARY-2026-05-21.md` |
| What did session pt-N do? | `docs/SESSION-HANDOVER-2026-05-{17..21}-pt{2..26}.md` |
| What does `e2e-day.mjs` cover? | `docs/E2E-AUDIT-2026-05-18.md` |
| Reconcile old gap-analysis with reality | `docs/STATUS-REALITY-2026-05-14.md` |
| FE app setup | `fe/README.md` |
| How are infra concerns organized? | `infra/migration-policy.md`, `infra/service-split-assessment.md` |

For day-to-day work, **HANDOFF.md (this file) + AUDIT-SUMMARY + the latest pt-N handover** is enough. The earlier per-session files are archive material.
