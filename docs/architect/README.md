# VNShop Architect Docs

Reference documentation for the VNShop full-stack e-commerce platform. This directory is the authoritative source for architecture, history, security posture, and operational patterns.

## What this project is

VNShop is a Vietnamese e-commerce platform built on a microservices backbone. The backend spans 16 services (Spring Boot for transactional services, NestJS for real-time services) coordinated through a Spring Cloud Gateway. The frontend is a React 18 SPA. All services communicate synchronously via REST through the gateway or asynchronously via Kafka events.

## Quick orientation

- **Entry point for new work:** Read `SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md` first to understand service boundaries, then `WHAT-WE-DID.md` to understand current state.
- **Before any security-adjacent change:** Read `SECURITY-AUDIT.md` to avoid re-introducing known findings.
- **When you hit a weird bug:** Check `BUGS-AND-GOTCHAS.md` — gotchas #119–131 cover the last two sessions alone.
- **Before making a trade-off decision:** Read `TRADE-OFFS.md` to see what's already been decided and why.
