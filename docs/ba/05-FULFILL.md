## Escrow Logic

### Escrow States

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Payment Method   │ Escrow Behavior              │
├──────────────────┼──────────────────────────────┤
│ VietQR/MoMo/Card │ Funds captured → held        │
│                  │ → released on confirm/auto    │
├──────────────────┼──────────────────────────────┤
│ COD              │ No escrow (cash on delivery)  │
│                  │ Seller bears non-payment risk │
├──────────────────┼──────────────────────────────┤
│ PayPal           │ PayPal holds → capture on     │
│                  │ confirm (authorize model)     │
├──────────────────┼──────────────────────────────┤
│ Stripe           │ Payment intent → capture on   │

│  Paid    Held    Shipped  Released              │
│                                                 │
│ "Your payment is held securely by VNShop.       │
│  It will be released to the seller once you     │
│  confirm delivery."                             │
